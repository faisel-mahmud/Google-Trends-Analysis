Google Trends Analysis Project

In this project, I analyzed Google Trends using the gTrendsR package provided by RStudio. I created dataframes to isolate data from categories of Google searches I am interested in. 
In this case, I analyzed searches for "Consumer Data" and "Business Formation" over the course of 5 years. I created data plots so to illustrate which cities have been searching with
keywords being "Consumer Data" and "Business Formation. All coding was done in RStudio and is live data from the time I created this project up to 5 years ago. To run the program, simply
press run all in RStudio.
